                                Enjoy what you are doing and referee with a smile on your face. The key to being a successful is having good man management skills – don’t always to control with the use of cards.
                                Also always look smart and professional – you will won over 50% of the players if you look the part.</li>

                                I can’t remember much about the game or the score all I can remember was the game being played at Porthkerry Park during a storm. I was wearing a white shirt and a knitted black jumper – and the end of the game I was totally drenched and struggled to walk off the pitch!</li>

                            <li><b>What Leagues Did You Referee In?</b>
                                I started off in the Barry & District League and later moved to Cardiff and refereed in the Cardiff Sunday league, the Civil Service League and Cardiff & District. I was then promoted to the South Wales Amateur and the Welsh League .</li>

                                So many different memories to note. I loved the time turning up to a game at Tongwynlais and the pitch wasn’t marked out – the players then ran around the village trying to get saw dust to mark the pitch. I also enjoyed having a good relationship with the more physical teams at the time and not having any problems.</li>
